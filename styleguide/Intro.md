# Stack Styled

React component for stack layouts: adds whitespace horizontal and vertical whitespace between each child but not around the container. Based on [styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system/table). We recommend to use thing component with [Grid Styled](https://jxnblk.com/grid-styled/).
