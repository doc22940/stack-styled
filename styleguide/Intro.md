# Stack Styled

React component to make stack layouts easy: adds whitespace horizontal and vertical whitespace between each child element but not around the container. Based on [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and CSS Grid. We recommend to use this component with [Rebass Grid](https://rebassjs.org/grid/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install stack-styled
```
